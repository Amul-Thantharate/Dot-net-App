# .NET - Demo Web Application

This is a simple .NET web app using the new minimal hosting model, and Razor pages. It was created from the `dotnet new webapp` template and modified adding custom APIs, Bootstrap v5, Microsoft Identity and other packages/features.

The app has been designed with cloud native demos & containers in mind, in order to provide a real working application for deployment, something more than "hello-world" but with the minimum of pre-reqs. It is not intended as a complete example of a fully functioning architecture or complex software design.

Typical uses would be deployment to Kubernetes, demos of Docker, CI/CD (build pipelines are provided), deployment to cloud (Azure) monitoring, auto-scaling

The app has several basic pages accessed from the top navigation menu, some of which are only lit up when certain configuration variables are set (see 'Optional Features' below):

- **Info** - Will show system & runtime information, and will also display if the app is running from within a Docker container and Kubernetes.
- **Tools** - Some tools useful in demos, such a forcing CPU load (for autoscale demos), and error/exception pages for use with App Insights or other monitoring tool.
- **Monitoring** - Displays realtime CPU load and memory working set charts, fetched from an REST API and displayed using chart.js
- **Weather** - (Optional) Gets the location of the client page (with HTML5 Geolocation). The resulting location is used to fetch a weather forecast from the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/)

Clone the project to any directory where you do development work

```
git clone https://github.com/Amul-Thantharate/Dot-net-App.git
```

### Makefile

A standard GNU Make file is provided to help with running and building locally.

```txt
$ make

help                 ðŸ’¬ This help message
lint                 ðŸ”Ž Lint & format, will not fix but sets exit code on error
image                ðŸ”¨ Build container image from Dockerfile
push                 ðŸ“¤ Push container image to registry
```

Make file variables and default values, pass these in when calling `make`, e.g. `make image IMAGE_REPO=blah/foo`

| Makefile Variable | Default                |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| IMAGE_REG         | ghcr<span>.</span>io   |
| IMAGE_REPO        | benc-uk/dotnet-demoapp |
| IMAGE_TAG         | latest                 |
| AZURE_RES_GROUP   | demoapps               |
| AZURE_REGION      | northeurope            |
| AZURE_APP_NAME    | dotnet-demoapp         |

Run in a container with:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 ghcr.io/benc-uk/dotnet-demoapp:latest
```

Should you want to build your own container, use `make image` and the above variables to customise the name & tag.
