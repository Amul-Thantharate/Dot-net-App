As a recent graduate with a passion for cloud-native technologies, I took on a key role in designing and deploying a practical application emphasizing cloud-native demos and containers. Focused on AWS deployment using Jenkins, this project goes beyond the typical 'hello-world,' offering a real working application with minimal prerequisites. While not a comprehensive example of a fully functioning architecture, it showcases my hands-on experience in deploying applications in a cloud environment. Excited to continue learning and contributing to innovative solutions in the world of cloud computing.
